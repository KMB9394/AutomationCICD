		//Let's assume you have a class called Product with attributes like id, name, price, and quantity. You want to verify products based on a specific condition, such as checking if the price of a product is above a certain threshold. We'll use this condition as an example.

	//	Create a Product class (if not already created):

		//javaCopy code
		   class Product {
		    private int id;
		    private String name;
		    private double price;
		    private int quantity;
			public double getPrice() {
				// TODO Auto-generated method stub
				return 0;
			}
		 
		    // Constructor, getters, setters, and other methods
		}
		//Create a list of products to work with:

		//javaCopy code
	//	List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
		// Add products to the list
	//	Use a Java stream to verify products based on your condition. In this example, we'll filter products with a price greater than or equal to a specific threshold (e.g., 50):

	//	javaCopy code
		double priceThreshold = 50.0;
		 
		Collection<Product> products;
		/*List<Product> verifiedProducts = products.stream()
		    .filter(product -> product.getPrice() >= priceThreshold)
		    .collect(Collectors.toList());*/
		//In the code above, we use the filter method to apply the condition to each product in the list. Products that meet the condition (i.e., their price is greater than or equal to priceThreshold) are included in the verifiedProducts list.

		//You can now work with the verifiedProducts list as needed. For example, you might print the verified products:

	//	javaCopy code
		System.out.println("Verified Products:");
		//verifiedProducts.forEach(product -> System.out.println(product.getName()));
		//This example demonstrates how to verify products using Java streams based on a specific condition. You can modify the condition inside the filter method to check for different product attributes or properties according to your requirements.
